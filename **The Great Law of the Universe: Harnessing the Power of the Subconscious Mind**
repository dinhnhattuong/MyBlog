The Great Law of the Universe: Harnessing the Power of the Subconscious Mind
We often hear that belief brings about what we desire. It's a simple notion that suggests everything in our lives, whether good or bad, whether intentional or unintentional, manifests through our thoughts sent out to the universe. And the universe responds in kind through the Law of Attraction. If you've read "The Secret" by Rhonda Byrne, you're likely familiar with the greatest power of the Universe: the Law of Attraction.

Mastering Your Thoughts: The Key to Effective Manifestation
Throughout history, many great minds, famous and successful individuals, have applied this secret to attract health, wealth, happiness, or other desires into their lives. Yet, why do many of us still struggle to apply it effectively? The most crucial reason is that we haven't mastered our own thoughts. Behind the scenes manipulating our thoughts is the subconscious, which often operates without our awareness. That's why the subconscious is said to have immense power but can also be incredibly daunting.

Understanding the Law of Sowing and Reaping
Whatever thoughts you sow, you will reap the results. The law of the universe is truly extremely simple. But why don't most people achieve what they want? Because they only focus on and think about what they don't have. Let your brain be the soil, your thoughts the seeds, your actions the water, and your emotions the sun.
If you sow positive thoughts into your brain and feel that you have already achieved it, and then plan, resolve, and make efforts to the end, then eventually it will become a reality in your life. Everything in the universe is energy. Even we ourselves are energy.
With all energies attracting each other at the same frequency, you cannot emit negative energy and expect a positive outcome. Sowing and reaping both take time. Planting desires and the brain are similar. We shouldn't rush to failure, but believe, affirm, and persevere.
The universe's process of turning your thoughts into reality is essentially the process of your growth and development. When your desires enter the subconscious, it will push you to think of things you've never thought of before, and immediately make you act towards success.
So how do you sow good thoughts and reap good things? The only way is to master your subconscious. Whether you believe it or not, in life, this world always wants to brainwash you, they always try to infiltrate and manipulate us. If we don't operate our subconscious ourselves, someone else will do it for us. The media, advertising industry, and propagators of ideas all want to brainwash us. That's why every year, billions of dollars are invested in advertising to infiltrate and influence consumers' knowledge.
When these things become part of the knowledge system, we are very likely to be controlled and sometimes our knowledge is extremely powerful, but also very susceptible to attack and intrusion. Therefore, to master our subconscious, we must brainwash ourselves.

Seven Core Truths about the Subconscious
Everything in the universe is energy, including ourselves. All energy resonates at the same frequency. You cannot emit negative energy and expect to achieve positive results. Similarly, you cannot sow thoughts of lack and reap success. According to the Law of Sowing and Reaping, the universe will germinate and turn those negative thoughts into unpleasant realities.
Always remember this: "Your life is what you think." This statement will remind you to immediately change your thoughts to a positive frequency. Both sowing and reaping require time. Planting good desires and beliefs in your mind is akin to planting seeds, and just like gardening, it requires time, effort, and patience. However, eventually, your desires will become reality. 

Reprogramming Your Subconscious for Success
So, how do you sow positive thoughts and reap positive outcomes? The only way is to take control of your own mind. Whether you believe it or not, the world is always trying to brainwash us. Media, advertising, and propagandists all aim to influence our subconscious minds. That's why people are willing to invest billions in advertising each year: to penetrate and manipulate our knowledge. If we don't operate our subconscious, someone else will. That's why it's crucial to "brainwash" ourselves.
Seven Core Truths about the Subconscious
Do you need to understand the nature of the subconscious? Let's explore the seven core truths about the subconscious:
•	First: The subconscious mind always records everything you see and hear, even information you're not consciously aware of. For example, if you fall asleep with the TV on, your subconscious can still hear everything playing on the TV.
•	Second: The subconscious records all memories and experiences in your life, storing them as movies and images in your mind. Therefore, you need to be clear about what you want throughout your life. Only when you know what you truly want and what is meaningful can you make the right choices. The right choices will bring positive experiences, which will strongly influence the subconscious and make it listen to you.
•	Third: The subconscious doesn't hear the word "no." If you say, "I don't smoke anymore," what the subconscious receives is the presence of "cigarettes," so it will continue to make you unable to quit smoking.
•	Fourth: The subconscious cannot distinguish between the future and the present. That's why if you have a goal, you should try to make the subconscious understand that you have already achieved that goal. For example, if you want to achieve $10 million, $100 million, or more, imagine, think, and feel as if you already have it.
•	Fifth: The subconscious cannot distinguish between imagination and reality. That's why you get goosebumps when watching horror movies. Your conscious mind knows it's fake, but your subconscious mind cannot tell the difference. So, take advantage of this secret of knowledge to imagine life and things you desire until you believe it's real, and the universe will respond and help you turn it into reality.
•	Sixth: The subconscious controls 95% of our lives. It forms habits, and we are the product of those habits. 95% of what you do today is a repetition of yesterday, meaning only about 5% of your time is consciously aware. Therefore, build good habits as soon as possible.
•	Seventh: Repetition can create new beliefs in our subconscious. When you repeatedly think or say something, whether true or false, eventually, the subconscious will begin to believe and act on it. Even if they are completely false, once you reach a certain level of belief, you will begin to attract what you have input into your knowledge. This is what you often think about. This rule is also called the "law of attraction," a very practical and extraordinarily powerful law of the universe. To achieve success, wealth, prosperity, and happiness as desired, you need to cleanse your mind by reprogramming your knowledge and repeating your thoughts every day.

Reprogramming Your Subconscious for Success
There are 8 simple steps to successfully reprogram your subconscious mind as you desire. 
•	The first step is to take a piece of paper and write down your specific desires. It can be anything, from a lifestyle to specific work or a beautiful garden house.
•	The second step is to start imagining that you have achieved your desires and goals. Let your desires unfold like a movie in your mind, and then feel it as if it has become a reality in your life. Remember that the subconscious mind cannot distinguish between imagination and reality.
•	In the third step, stop looking at images or movies that do not reflect your beliefs. The subconscious is always influenced, so you need to create the right influence for it. Focus your attention and energy only on things that help you achieve your desires and goals.
•	The fourth step is to design a short, positive affirmation for yourself. Note that you have achieved your goal. For example, if you want success, the affirmation could be "I am successful, I have signed contracts for projects A, B, C." If you want more money, the affirmation could be "I am very prosperous, I have 1 billion in my account." Remember that the subconscious world only knows about the present, so your affirmation should be designed for the present moment.
•	The fifth step is to set an alarm clock on your phone to remind you to speak affirmations at a fixed time of day. Repeat this every day, and when speaking affirmations, imagine the related images.
•	In the sixth step, listen again to the affirmations you have designed. Record your affirmations and listen to them every night while you are in a dreamy state. The subconscious mind easily absorbs your affirmations in this state.
•	In the seventh step, start talking about your desires as if they have become a reality. And the eighth step is to repeat, repeat, and repeat positive habits and beliefs will be formed through repetition. According to many studies, we need at least 21 days to form a new habit. So, try to repeat these methods for at least 21 days, and you will see miracles happen.
Enhancing Control of the Subconscious Mind:
Finally, we need to learn methods to enhance and master our knowledge. There are 4 types of energy waves in our brain. Beta waves are brain waves that appear in stressful situations, such as when we work or are nervous. Alpha waves are brain waves in a relaxed state, such as when we close our eyes and imagine, meditate, or watch a movie. Theta waves are brain waves that enter a deep meditation state. And delta waves are brain waves in a deep sleep state.

There are 3 methods to enhance and control our subconscious mind.
The first method is meditation, which is the most effective way to adjust brain waves. The time when you wake up and before going to bed is the most influential time for the subconscious, so meditate during these times.
The second method is gratitude for everything you want and already have in life. Express gratitude and focus on the feeling of gratitude before going to bed or upon waking up.
The final method is visualization, which helps connect and make the subconscious mind listen to you. Start visualizing yourself in a new life and imagine yourself becoming a great person in the way you want.
By practicing these methods every day, you will begin to let go of old images of yourself, and new positive thoughts will gradually have a strong impact on your subconscious mind. At this point, the universe will arrange people and things close to you so that you can take action immediately. Once you act, be patient and determined, and you will reap success and the greatest things in life.
